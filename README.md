## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

* Java 8 or later

* A project containing Java test cases

## Steps

1. Make sure you have the prerequisites as noted above: Java 8 or later, Maven 3+, and a project containing two Java test cases.

2. Open the project in your IDE and set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to its installation directory.

3. Open a command-line window, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

        mvn clean test

4. The build should generate a test report, which you can find under the **target/surefire-reports** folder. 

5. Open the report and check the results of the test cases.
